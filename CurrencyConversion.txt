Welcome Page:
	In the welcome page you'll find Login options through either sign up or sign in,
 Once we proveide necessary details, say name and password.The user data is stored in the
 localStorage and you'll be redirected to CurrencyConversion page. And if we fail to 
provide the necessary details and try to go to the login page we are show an error message.

Currency Conversion Page:
	In here, we can view through whose account we logged in by accessing the data from 
local storage and we'll be able to define source and target currencies through a dropdown
 menu. And find the appropriate currency value.When user chose to logout from the application
he can do that by pressing logout button we provided in the navbar which redirects him to
the login page and erasing the user data from local storage.



Personally I,ve gone for this simplistic design with only two webpages is: 

a)It is easy to operate as I've placed placeholders and error messages.
b)It performs the required operations that needs to be fulfilled.
c)It adds , accesses and removes the userdata from localstorage.





Mockups that can be added:
	
a)Displaying realtime currency exchange rates in a graph.
b)A calculator option for calculating the percentages and EMI options.
